    <article>
        <p>My name is Laurette, a lot of people call me Vila because that is my nickname and it's what I like
            going by. I was born in Rwanda and later on I moved to the U.S with my parents and siblings. I have three
            siblings and I'm the second born. I have a big sister, a little sister and my younger brother. I like to
            live a quiet private life, keeping my things organized, having a small circle and achieving my goals while
            doing what I love.</p>

        <p>I'm currently a senior in high school at Kettering Fairmont High School, I'm in Information Technology CTC
            because I want to work in an IT field in the future and as a girl, there are not a lot females in IT fields
            so I feel like it will be an amazing opportunity to be one of the few who are into technology.</p>

        <p>In my daily life, I enjoy hanging out with people I love like my close friends and family.
            In my free time, I like to watch movies, listen to music, play with kids, go shopping and I really like
            adventures. I prefer watching football over all other sports and my favorite team is the Tennessee Titans. I
            grew up as a Christian and my parents taught me to have discipline and to help those in need so I love
            helping people and I love to be around babies. They are just amazing!</p>
