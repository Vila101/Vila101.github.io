      <p>
         During school days I don't likely do a lot and my routine doesn't change a lot. I get up in the morning at 6:40
         a.m, take a shower and get ready for school. I help mom get my little sister ready for school also and then mom
         drops us.
         As a senior, most of my classes we do projects and throughout the day I try to work hard and finish my school
         works.
         When I get back home, I change and put on my gym clothes then head to the gym and workout for an hour or more.
         I don't
         go to the gym everyday so when I'm home I help mom with some chores, watch movies or hangout with friends.

         <p>I like to cook, so most of the times I'm the one who cook at home. Some of my favorite food, there is
            lasagna, fried chicken, sushi and most of the sea foods. My favorite place to go eat is in Mexican
            reastaurants.</p>

         <h1>Music and Movies</h1>
         <p>I love listening to music, that's why I encourage people to attend music concerts because they are fun and
            you get to meet new people and experience good loud music. My best favorite artists are Partynextdoor, Tory
            Lanez, Gunna, Ken Carson, Polo G and Rema. I also love watching movies, mostly when I'm with my friends and
            I prefer horror and sci-fi movies.</p>
